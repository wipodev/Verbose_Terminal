# Verbose Terminal [![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/verbose-terminal.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/verbose-terminal/) [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/verbose-terminal)](https://pepy.tech/project/verbose-terminal)

## Description

Verbose Terminal is a Python library that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for displaying styled messages in the terminal. It includes predefined styles for success, warning, error, and informational messages, both with and without background colors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install verbose-terminal
```

## Usage

Import the `console` class from the `verbose_terminal` module and use its methods to print styled messages. The following examples demonstrate how to use the library:

### Basic Usage

```python
from verbose_terminal import console

# Displaying messages with different styles
console.log("This is a plain message.")
console.debug("This is a debug message.")
console.info("Here is some information.")
console.success("Operation completed successfully!")
console.warning("This is a warning message.")
console.error("An error has occurred.")
console.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

## Verbose Flag

By default, the `verbose` flag is set to `True`. This means that the messages will be displayed on the terminal. To not display messages in the terminal, set the `verbose` flag to `False`.

```python
from verbose_terminal import console

# Displaying messages in the terminal
console.log("This message will be displayed.")
console.log("This message will not be displayed.", verbose=False)
```

## Logging

Verbose Terminal can also log all messages to a file, whether they are printed to the terminal or not.

### Enable Logging

To enable logging, use the `enable_logging` method and specify a log file:

```python
from verbose_terminal import console

# Enable logging to 'messages.log'
console.enable_logging('messages.log')
```

### Log flag level

By default, the `log_level` flag is set to `INFO`. Only messages will be recorded: info, success, warning, error and critical, if you want to add the debug and log messages you must pass the `LOG` flag

```python
from verbose_terminal import console

# Enable logging to 'messages.log'
console.enable_logging('messages.log', log_level='LOG')
```

### Disable Logging

To disable logging, use the `disable_logging` method:

```python
from verbose_terminal import console

# Disable logging
console.disable_logging()
```

### View Logs

To view the logs, use the `view_logs` method:

```python
from verbose_terminal import console

# View logs
print(console.view_logs())
```

### Clear Logs

To clear the logs, use the `clear_logs` method:

```python
from verbose_terminal import console

# Clear logs
console.clear_logs()
```

### Save Logs

To save the logs to a file, use the `save_logs` method:

```python
from verbose_terminal import console

# Save logs to 'logs.txt'
console.save_logs('logs.txt')
```
